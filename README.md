# Thesis R scripts
### R scripts used to analyze qPCR data of defence response genes in chickpea:

* [qPCR_statistical_analysis.R](qPCR_statistical_analysis.R) - This file is used to read raw qPC data and perform ddCq calculation between experimantal groups and test for significance using ANOVA.  
* [RGA_qPCR_heatmap.R](RGA_qPCR_heatmap.R) - This file is used to create a heatmap of ddCq values between samples.
* [qPCR_data_processing.R](qPCR_data_processing.R) - This file is used to import raw qPCR data from each plate, combine them to a single spreadsheet, convert it to a format suitable for [LinRegPCR and Factor-qPCR](https://www.genetargetsolutions.com.au/qpcr/linregpcr-and-factor-qpcr/) and produce gene expression plots.
